# Garbage Goober ü§ñüíßüß¥

**Garbage Goober** is a whimsical yet hardworking recycling robot designed to help keep our planet clean, one bottle at a time. With sensors, AI, and a love for litter, Garbage Goober identifies, collects, and properly disposes of water bottles to make sure they‚Äôre recycled. This project is a tribute to the beloved *Rick and Morty* character with a mission to tackle plastic waste!

## Features

- **Bottle Detection**: Uses state-of-the-art object detection to identify water bottles in the environment.
- **Navigation**: Autonomous navigation to seek and collect plastic bottles.
- **Friendly & Efficient**: Garbage Goober loves doing his job, never misses a bottle, and never complains.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Keeps you updated on its collection stats and progress.
